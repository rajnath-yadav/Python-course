    "#### 1) Suppose that in this term you have only two courses: Calculus II and Programming Languages. Create a function **grades()** that receives two tuples (or lists) of three elements representing the grades of the assigments A1, A2 and A3 in that order. The first tuple (or list) refers to the grades of Calculus II and the second to the grades of Programming Languages. Return a dictionary whose keys are the names of the course and the values are another dict with keys 'A1', 'A2' and 'A3' and values being the corresponding grades. See example below.\n",

In addition, the employee class must have the method `bonus()`, which does not receive parameters and increases the employee's salary by 10%. The manager class must have the methods `authenticate_password(password)`, which returns a Boolean resulting from the validation of the password against the entry, and the method `bonus()`, which increases your salary by 15%.
