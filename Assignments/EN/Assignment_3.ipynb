    "#### 3) Create the class **Ball**, to represent a sphere filled with water (weighing 1000g per cubic meter) with a radius **r**. Depending on the surface painting, it can have different weights: blue - weight 1g per square meter: yellow - 2g per square meter or red - 3g per square meter. The class parameter is a tuple **(r, color)**, an integer and a string, respectively. The **weight()** method of the class should return the total weight in kg of the ball (the weight of the water with the external weight of the surface). See example:\n",

    "#### 5) The **area()** function receives a list **l** of ordered pairs. These ordered pairs represent the vertices of a convex polygon in the Cartesian plane traversed in a single direction. There is a mathematical method that, given the coordinates of the vertices of a polygon, the area can be calculated. You can find more details about the method by clicking [here](https://www.mathopenref.com/coordpolygonarea.html). Your code should make the function return the number that corresponds to the area of the polygon represented by the entry (rounded to two decimal places). See the following examples:\n",
